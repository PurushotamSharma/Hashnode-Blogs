Hello Everyone, Welcome to my new Blog Day 16 task for DevOps Engineer. In today's task I will talk to you about Docker and its basic commands. So today's agenda:-

### Agenda:

**Docker**

**Basic Commands (Task)**

## What is Docker?

Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.

# Tasks:

As we install the docker in the last blog. so today we get started with the basic commands of the Docker.

◈`docker run:-It is used to start a new container and interact with it through the command line.`

for this command first we pull the image of any file or program then run that image.

So for example I am taking the image from the docker hub and after that I will run that image.

commands use.

`docker pull:- for pulling the image from the docker hub.`

`docker run.`

◈ **docker inspect** This command is used to see the detailed information about the container and image.

this type of all detailed information you can see by the docker inspect.

**docker port:** This command is used to list the port mapping for the container.

**docker stats:** This command is used to view resource usage statistics for one or more containers.

by this command we use see CPU usage % , memory usage and etc.

**docker top :** This command is used to view the processes running inside a container.

**docker save:** This command is used to save the image in tar archive.

**docker load:** This command is used to load the image from the tar archive.

These tasks involve simple operations that can be used to manage images and containers.
