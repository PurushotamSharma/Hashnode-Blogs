‚û¶CLI commands and API operation for the patching.

‚û¶Backup

‚û¶Recovery

‚û¶Database Setup

‚û¶Failure deduction and repair

‚û¶ Aurora is specifically designed for high performance and scalability. It uses a distributed, fault-tolerant architecture that allows it to scale out across multiple instances. This can provide higher throughput and lower latency compared to traditional MySQL RDS instances.

### ‚û§ Performace:

‚û¶ Aurora is specifically designed for high performance and scalability. It uses a distributed, fault-tolerant architecture that allows it to scale out across multiple instances. This can provide higher throughput and lower latency compared to traditional MySQL RDS instances.

‚û¶ MySQL RDS offers standard MySQL database engines. While it also supports scalability and performance enhancements, it may not match the performance capabilities of Aurora, especially for demanding workloads.

‚û¶ Amazon Aurora replicates 2 copies of data in each availability zone (minimum of 3 AZ). So a total of 6 copies per region.

## ‚úçÔ∏èAmazon DocumentDB

Amazon DocumentDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that manages MongoDB databases in AWS.

### ‚û§ Features:

‚û¶ It is a non-relational database service and supports document data structures.

‚û¶ Using DocumentDB with Amazon CloudWatch helps to monitor the health and performance of the instances in a cluster.

‚û¶ It works by building clusters that consist of 0 - 16 database instances (1 primary and 15 read replicas) and a cluster storage volume.

‚û¶ It provides 99.99% availability by copying the cluster's data in three different Availability Zones.

‚û¶ It helps to scale storage and compute services independently.

‚û¶ It provides automatic failover either to one of up to 15 replicas created in other Availability Zones or to a new instance if no replicas have been provisioned.

‚û¶ It provides backup capability and point-in-time recovery for the cluster. It has a backup retention period of up to 35 days.

‚û¶ It is best suited for TTL and Timeseries Workloads and supports ACID properties based on transactions across one or more documents.

## ‚úçÔ∏èAmazon DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a serverless NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with single-digit millisecond latency.

## ‚û§ Features:

‚û¶ It provides a push button scaling feature, signifying that DB can scale without any downtime.

‚û¶ It is a multi-region cloud service that supports key-value and document data structure.

‚û¶ It provides high availability and data durability by replicating data synchronously on solid-state disks (SSDs) across 3 AZs in a region.

‚û¶ It helps to store session states and supports ACID transactions for business-critical application

‚û¶ It provides the on-demand backup capability of the tables for long- term retention and enables point-in-time recovery from accidental write or delete operations.

‚û¶ Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a highly available in- memory cache service that provides data from DynamoDB tables. DAX is not used for strongly consistent reads and write-intensive workloads.

‚û¶ It supports Cross-Region Replication using DynamoDB Global Tables. Global Tables helps to deploy a multi-region database and provide automatic multi-master replication to AWS regions.

## ‚úçÔ∏èAmazon ElastiCache

ElastiCache is a web service used to manage and run in memory data stores Redis and Memcached in the cloud.

### ‚û§ Features:

‚û¶ It is best suited for online Analytical Processing (OLAP) transaction workloads and for storing session states.

‚û¶ It has in- memory caching features provide sub-millisecond laency for read-heavy application workloads.

### ‚û§ Amazon ElastiCache for Redis:

‚û¶ It is useful for gaming applications, geospatial service, caching session stores and replication.

‚û¶ Data is persistent.

‚û¶ It is not multi-threaded.

‚û¶ It supports Multiple Availability Zones using read replicas.

### ‚û§ Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached:

‚û¶ It is useful for building applications that require caching layers.

‚û¶ Data is not persistent.

‚û¶ It supports Multi-threading.

‚û¶ It does not support Multi-AZ flavour.

‚û¶ It does not support snapshots.

## ‚úçÔ∏èAmazon Keyspaces

Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a serverless service used to manage the Apache Cassandra database in AWS.

It provides the following throughput capacity modes for reads and writes.

* On-demand: Charges are applied for the reads and writes performed.
    
* Provisioned: Charges are minimized by specifying the number of reads and writes per second in advance.
    
* Using Amazon Keyspaces, tables can be scaled automatically, and read-write costs can be optimized by choosing either on-demand or provisioned capacity mode
    

### ‚û§ Functions of the Keyspaces

‚û¶ It helps to run existing Cassandra workloads on AWS without making any changes to the Cassandra application code.

‚û¶ It eliminates the developers‚Äô operational burden such as scaling, patching, updates, server maintenance, and provisioning.

‚û¶ It offers high availability and durability by maintaining three copies of data in multiple Availability Zones.

‚û¶It implements the Apache Cassandra Query Language (CQL) API for using CQL and Cassandra drivers similar to Apache Cassandra.

‚û¶ It helps to build applications that can serve thousands of requests with single-digit-millisecond response latency.

‚û¶ It continuously backups hundreds of terabytes of table data and provides point-in-time recovery in the next 35 days.

## ‚úçÔ∏èAmazon Neptune:

Amazon Neptune is a graph database service used as a web service to build and run applications that require connected datasets.
