In today’s session, we will unravel the key components of IAM, exploring the basics that will empower you to control access to AWS resources effectively. From users and groups to policies and permissions, we’ll navigate through the IAM landscape to provide you with a solid foundation.

So, buckle up as we embark on this journey into ‘Understanding IAM Basics.’ By the end of today’s session, you’ll have a clearer understanding of how IAM works and be better equipped to design and implement secure access controls in your AWS environment.

Let’s dive in!”

### What is IAM?

IAM stands for Identity and Access Management, a fundamental service within Amazon Web Services(AWS). IAM enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users. Essentially, IAM allows you to manage identities (users, groups, and roles) and their respective permissions to interact with AWS resources.

Let’s see how the IAM Service look like…

How to access IAM service:

1.  Go to the AWS Console, In the search Bar search for IAM
2.  After that, you will see this interface…

### IAM Concepts 🔐:

### Authentication:

IAM authenticates the identity of users, services, or applications who trying to access AWS resources. Authentication involves proving identity through mechanisms like usernames and passwords, or access keys.

### Authorization:

Once authenticated, IAM authorizes users based on policies. Authorization determines what actions users, groups, or roles are allowed to perform on AWS resources.

**In IAM there are mainly 4 key components…**

*   Groups
*   Users
*   Roles
*   Policies

1.  **Groups:**

IAM groups are collections of users with similar access requirements. Instead of managing permissions for each individual, you can assign permissions to groups, making it easier to manage access control. Users can be added or deleted as needed.

For creating Group

*   Go to the IAM Service and click on the Users Groups after that you will see this type of interface..

*   Now click on the Create group

*   In the first section write the group name and in the second section, you can add the users in this particular group. and at the give permissions to the group and click on create group.
*   Congrats!! you created your first group in the IAM Service.

**2\. Users:**

IAM users represent individual people or entities that interact with your AWS resources. Each user has a unique name and security credentials(password or access key) used for authentication and access control.

Let’s create the user…

*   First, go to the AWS console, search for IAM Service, and click on the Users.
*   Now click on the Create User and give the username for your user.

*   Now click on Provide user access to the AWS Management Console

*   Now you can give the custom password or you can leave by default autogenerated password
*   Now click on next.

*   Now you can see the 3 permission options first is Add user to group means if there is already one or you want to permit the whole group then you can choose this, Second is copy permission in which you can copy the permission of your older groups and create this, and the last but not least you can directly attach the permissions.
*   I am here for demo purposes I am selecting the 1 option to add a user to the group
*   Now click on the next

*   By default there will be only one permission given to your user is he or she can change the password
*   Now you review and click on Create user.

*   Now you use the URL for the sign-in as an IAM user and you can download this .csv file.
*   Congrats!! You Created one User using the IAM service.

**3\. Roles:**

IAM roles are used to grant temporary access to AWS resources. Roles are typically used by applications or services that need to access AWS resources on behalf of users or other services. Roles have associated policies that define the permissions and actions allowed for the role.

4\. **Policies**:

IAM policies are JSON documents that define permissions. Policies specify the actions that can be performed on AWS resources and the resources to which the actions apply. Policies can be attached to users, groups, or roles to control access. IAM provides both AWS-managed policies (predefined policies maintained by AWS) and customer-managed policies (policies created and managed by you).

### The task for the Day

### Create an IAM User:

1.  **Use the AWS Management Console:**

*   Go to the IAM dashboard.
*   Create a new user, assign a username, choose access type (console, programmatic), and attach policies.

**2\. Understand Access Keys:**

*   For programmatic access, learn about access keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) and how they are used.

Task 1 we have completed now let’s look forward to task 2.

### What is Access Keys?

An access key is a set of credentials used in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) that permits programmatic access to AWS services. Access keys can be used by IAM users or AWS services to send secure API queries to AWS services. An access key ID and a secret access key are the two components that make up an access key.

**Access Key ID:**

An IAM user, an AWS account, or an AWS service that is submitting requests to AWS can all be uniquely identified by their access key ID. When using API calls, it’s utilized to determine the request’s origin.

**Secret Access ID:**

A hidden piece of data known as the secret access key is used to certify requests sent to AWS services. Only AWS and the user or service are aware of it. It should not be disclosed and should be kept private. Multiple access keys may be linked to one account by IAM users. When utilizing the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), AWS SDKs, or other services and tools that communicate with AWS programmatically, access keys are frequently needed.

Safe access key management is crucial. To improve security, AWS advises frequently rotating access keys. Additionally, the related access keys ought to be removed from the system when a user no longer requires programmatic access.

To establish and control IAM access keys:

**Create the access keys:**

Access keys can be generated either during the IAM user setup process or after via the AWS CLI or IAM console.

**Manage Access Keys:**

Access keys can be managed by users via the IAM API, AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs. This covers changing, erasing, or producing fresh access keys.

**Rotate Access Keys :**

One security best practice to lower the danger of unwanted access is to regularly rotate access keys. You can use the AWS Management dashboard to create and manage access keys by going to the “Security credentials” tab in the IAM dashboard after selecting the user. You may rotate, manage, and generate new access keys there.

When it comes to access keys, always use caution and don’t hardcode them in configuration files or code. Instead, securely give temporary credentials using IAM roles or other methods.
