## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is a general term for the delivery of hosted computing services and IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

**Example**: DropBox, Gmail

## Types of Cloud:

There are mainly three types of clouds:

1. Public Cloud
    
2. Private Cloud
    
3. Hybrid Cloud
    

### Public Cloud:

The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third-party providers over the public internet making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them.

### Private Cloud:

In the Private Cloud resources are used by only a single organization, which provides more control and customization but requires more maintenance.
