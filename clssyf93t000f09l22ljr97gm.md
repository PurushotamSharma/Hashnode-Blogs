## ‚úçÔ∏è AWS Step Functions:

AWS Setup Function is a serverless orchestration service that converts an application's workflow into a series of steps by combining AWS Lambda functions and other AWS Services.

**‚û• Standard Workflow:**

* It executes once in a workflow execution for up to one year.
    
* They are ideal for long-running and auditable workflows.
    

**‚û• Express Workflow:**

* It executes at least once in a workflow execution for up to five minutes.
    
* They are ideal for high-processing workloads, such as streaming data processing and IOT data ingestion.
    

**‚ûú Execution is the instances where workflow runs to perform tasks.**

‚ûú AWS Step Functions resemble state machines and tasks. Each step in a workflow is a state. The output of one step signifies an input to the next results in function orchestration.

‚ûú It helps to execute each step in an order defined by the business logic of the application  
‚ûú It provides some built-in functionalities like sequencing, error handling, timeout handling, and removing a significant operational overhead from the t  
‚ûú It can control other AWS services, like AWS Lambda (to perform tasks), processing machine learning models, AWS Glue (to create an extract, transform, and load (ETL) workflows), and automated workflows that require human approval.  
‚ûú It provides multiple automation features like routine deployments, upgrades, installations, migrations, patch management, infrastructure selection, and data synchronization.

## ‚úçÔ∏èAmazon EventBridge:

Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that connects applications with data from multiple sources.

**Amazon EventBridge integrates with the following services:**

‚ûú AWS CloudTraik

‚ûú AWS CloudFormation

‚ûú AWS Config  
‚ûú AWS IAM(Identify and Access Management)

‚ûú AWS Kinesis Data Streams

‚ûú AWS Lambda

### ‚û• Functions of Amazon EventBridge:

‚ûú An event bus is an entity that receives events, and rules get attached to that event bus that matches the events received.

‚ûú It helps to build loosely coupled and distributed event-driven architectures.

‚ûú It connects applications and delivers the events without the need to write custom code.

‚ûú It delivers a stream of real-time data from SaaS applications or other AWS services and routes that data to different targets such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon ECS tasks, AWS CodeBuild projects, etc.

‚ûú It sets up routing rules that determine the targets to build application architectures that react according to the data sources.

The EventBridge schema registry stores a collection of event structures (schemas) and allows users to download code for those schemas in the IDE representing events as objects in the code.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Amazon SNS:

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a serverless notification service that offers message delivery from publishers to subscribers.

‚ûú It creates asynchronous communication between publishers and subscribers by sending messages to a ‚Äòtopic.‚Äô

‚ûú It supports application-to-application subscribers that include Amazon SQS and other AWS services and Application-to-person subscribers that include Mobile SMS, Email, etc.

### ‚û• SNS helps to publish messages to many subscriber endpoints:

* Amazon SQS Queues
    
* AWS Lambda function
    
* Email
    
* Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
    
* Mobile push
    
* SMS
    

## ‚úçÔ∏èAmazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a serverless service used to decouple (loose couple) serverless applications and components.

The queue represents a temporary repository between the producer and consumer of messages.

‚ùë It can scale up to 1-10000 messages per second.

‚ùë The default retention period of messages is four days and can be extended to fourteen days.

‚ùë SQS messages get automatically deleted after being consumed by the consumers. ‚ùë SQS messages have a fixed size of 256KB.

‚û¶ **Delay Queue** is a queue that allows users to postpone/delay the delivery of messages to a queue for a specific number of seconds. Messages can be delayed for 0 seconds (default) or -15 (maximum) minutes.

‚û¶ **Visibility Timeout** is the amount of time during which SQS prevents other consumers from receiving (poll) and processing the messages. Default visibility timeout - 30 seconds Minimum visibility timeout - 0 seconds Maximum visibility timeout - 12 hours

**There are two SQS Queue types:**

‚û¶ **Standard Queue -**

‚ûú The unlimited number of transactions per second.

‚ûú Messages get delivered in any order.

‚ûú Messages can be sent twice or multiple times.

‚û¶ **FIFO Queue -**

‚ûú 300 messages per second.

‚ûú Support batches of 10 messages per operation, resulting in 3000 messages per second.

‚ûú Messages get consumed only once

‚û¶ **Dead-Letter** Queue is a queue for those messages that are not consumed successfully. It is used to handle message failure.

## ‚úçÔ∏è AWS AppSync:

AWS AppSync is a serverless service used to build GraphQL API with real-time data synchronization and offline programming features.

**GraphQL is a data language built to allow apps to fetch data from servers.**

‚ûú It replaces the functionality of Cognito Sync by providing offline data synchronization.

‚ûú It improves performance by providing data caches, provides subscriptions to support real-time updates, and provides client-side data stores to keep off-line clients in sync.

‚ûú It offers certain advantages over GraphQL, such as enhanced coding style and seamless integration with modern tools and frameworks like iOS and Android.

‚ûú AppSync interface provides a live GraphQL API feature that allows users to test and iterate on GraphQL schemas and data sources quickly.

‚ûú Along with AppSync, AWS provides an Amplify Framework that helps build mobile and web applications using GraphQL API.

The different data sources supported by AppSync are:

* Amazon DynamoDB tables
    
* Third-Party HTTP Endpoints
    
* Amazon Elasticsearch
    
* AWS Lambda Functions
    
* RDS Database
    

‚û¶ **Queries:** For fetching data from the API

‚û¶ **Mutations:** For changing data via API

‚û¶ **Subscriptions:** The connections for streaming data from API

## ‚úçÔ∏è Amazon Simple Workflow Service:

Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) is used to coordinate work amongst distributed application components.

‚ûú A task is a logical representation of work performed by a component of the application.

‚ûú Tasks are performed by implementing workers and execute either on Amazon EC2 or on on-premise servers (which means it is not a serverless service).

‚ûú Amazon SWF stores tasks and assigns them to workers during execution.

‚ûú It controls task implementation and coordination, such as tracking and maintaining the state using API.

‚ûú It helps to create distributed asynchronous applications and supports sequential and parallel processing.

‚ûú It is best suited for human-intervened workflows.

‚ûú Amazon SWF is a less-used service, so AWS Step Functions is the better option than SWF.
