## Introduction:

Setting up a cron job using a Lambda function provides a powerful and efficient way to automate tasks in a serverless environment. Cron jobs, traditionally used in Unix-like operating systems, are scheduled tasks that run at specified intervals ‚è∞. Leveraging Lambda functions in cloud environments such as AWS (Amazon Web Services), enables developers to execute code without managing servers üöÄ, making it an ideal solution for periodic tasks. This guide will walk through the process of configuring and deploying a cron job using Lambda functions, empowering developers to automate recurring tasks seamlessly within their cloud infrastructure. üõ†Ô∏è

### ‚û¶ Let's Start Step by Step:

‚ûú First we create a lambda function and if you already have then that is great.

‚ûú First go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Lambda Service.

‚ûú Are you ready to create something amazing? Let's get started! Simply click on "Create a function" in the interface and begin your journey towards greatness.

‚ûú We will be creating a function from the Scratch

Congrats!! We created the Cron job using the Lambda Function.

Happy Learning!
