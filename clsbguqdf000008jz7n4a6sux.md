### Introduction:

Welcome to Day 14 of our exhilarating AWS 30 Days Challenge! Today, we‚Äôre embarking on a thrilling journey into the heart of AWS CodeDeploy, the deployment dynamo that transforms the way we launch applications into the cloud. üåêüíª

### What is CodeDeploy?

Code Deploy is a service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that automates the deployment of code to servers. It makes it easy for developers to update their applications without having to manually manage the process.

Code Deploy works by creating a deployment group, which is a collection of servers that you want to deploy your code. You can then create a deployment configuration, which specifies how you want to deploy your code. For example, you can choose to deploy your code to all servers in the deployment group at once, or you can deploy it to a subset of servers and then gradually roll it out to the rest of the group.

Code Deploy also provides several features that make it easier to manage your deployments. For example, you can use Code Deploy to track the progress of your deployments, and you can roll back to a previous version of your code if there is a problem.

Overall, Code Deploy is a powerful tool that can help developers deploy their code more easily and efficiently.

In very simple Word code deploy is a service to deploy your code to the Servers.

### What is appspec.yaml file?

The Application Specification file (AppSpec file) is a YAML or JSON formatted file used by the code deploy service to manage deployment.

Later in this blog, we will discuss how to create the AppSpec.yaml file.

Before Jumping to the step-by-step guide let‚Äôs first discuss the Code Deploy Components:

1.  **Application:** An *application* is a name that uniquely identifies the application you want to deploy. CodeDeploy uses this name, which functions as a container, to ensure the correct combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during a deployment.
2.  **Compute Platform:** A *computing platform* is a platform on which CodeDeploy deploys an application. There are three computing platforms:

*   **EC2/On-Premises**: Describes instances of physical servers that can be Amazon EC2 cloud instances, on-premises servers, or both. Applications created using the EC2/On-Premises compute platform can be composed of executable files, configuration files, images, and more.
*   **AWS Lambda**: Used to deploy applications that consist of an updated version of a Lambda function. AWS Lambda manages the Lambda function in a serverless computing environment made up of a high-availability computing structure. All administration of the compute resources is performed by AWS Lambda
*   **Amazon ECS**: Used to deploy an Amazon ECS containerized application as a task set. CodeDeploy performs a blue/green deployment by installing an updated version of the application as a new replacement task set. CodeDeploy reroutes production traffic from the original application task set to the replacement task set. The original task set is terminated after a successful deployment.

3. **Deployment Configuration:** A *deployment configuration* is a set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure conditions used by CodeDeploy during a deployment. If your deployment uses the EC2/On-Premises compute platform, you can specify the minimum number of healthy instances for the deployment. If your deployment uses the AWS Lambda or the Amazon ECS compute platform, you can specify how traffic is routed to your updated Lambda function or ECS task set.

4\. **Deployment type:** A *deployment type* is a method used to make the latest application revision available on instances in a deployment group. There are two deployment types:

*   **In-place deployment**: The application on each instance in the deployment group is stopped, the latest application revision is installed, and the new version of the application is started and validated. You can use a load balancer so that each instance is deregistered during its deployment and then restored to service after the deployment is complete. Only deployments that use the EC2/On-Premises compute platform can use in-place deployments.
*   **Blue/green deployment**: The behaviour of your deployment depends on which compute platform you use

5. **Revision:** A revision is a version of your application.

6\. **Service Role¬†:**

A *service role* is an IAM role that grants permissions to an AWS service so it can access AWS resources. The policies you attach to the service role determine which AWS resources the service can access and the actions it can perform with those resources. For CodeDeploy, a service role is used for the following:

*   To read either the tags applied to the instances or the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group names associated with the instances. This enables CodeDeploy to identify instances to which it can deploy applications.
*   To perform operations on instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, and Elastic Load Balancing load balancers.
*   Publish information to Amazon SNS topics so that notifications can be sent when specified deployment or instance events occur.
*   To retrieve information about CloudWatch alarms to set up alarm monitoring for deployments.

*   We need to install the CodeDeploy agent on the server for which we need to write a script file with all the dependencies.

#!/bin/bash   
  
\# This script installs the CodeDeploy agent and its prerequisites on Ubuntu 22.04.   
  
\# Update package list  
sudo apt-get update   
  
\# Install Ruby and its dependencies  
sudo apt-get install ruby-full ruby-webrick wget -y   
  
\# Change to temporary directory  
cd /tmp   
  
\# Download the CodeDeploy agent package  
wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/releases/codedeploy-agent\_1.3.2-1902\_all.deb   
  
\# Create a directory to extract the package contents  
mkdir codedeploy-agent\_1.3.2-1902\_ubuntu22   
  
\# Extract the package contents  
dpkg-deb -R codedeploy-agent\_1.3.2-1902\_all.deb codedeploy-agent\_1.3.2-1902\_ubuntu22   
  
\# Update the package dependencies to use Ruby 3.0  
sed 's/Depends:.\*/Depends:ruby3.0/' -i ./codedeploy-agent\_1.3.2-1902\_ubuntu22/DEBIAN/control   
  
\# Repackage the updated package  
dpkg-deb -b codedeploy-agent\_1.3.2-1902\_ubuntu22/   
  
\# Install the updated package  
sudo dpkg -i codedeploy-agent\_1.3.2-1902\_ubuntu22.deb   
  
\# List all systemd units that contain "codedeploy" in their name  
systemctl list-units --type\=service | grep codedeploy   
  
\# Check the status of the CodeDeploy agent service  
sudo service codedeploy-agent status

*   Create install.sh, file and execute the shell script.
*   Our code deploy agent is running

*   Now we will add the appspec.yaml file to the repository and completed the deployment.
*   The app Spec file is required to create a bridge between the AWS CodeDeploy and the EC2 instance. Create the yaml file.
*   appspec. yaml

version: 0.0  
os: linux  
files:  
  \- source: /  
    destination: /var/www/html  
hooks:  
  AfterInstall:  
    \- location: scripts/install\_nginx.sh  
      timeout: 300  
      runas: root  
  ApplicationStart:  
    \- location: scripts/start\_nginx.sh  
      timeout: 300  
      runas: root

*   Create the dependency files as well for installing and starting nginx on the server.
*   install\_nginx.sh

#!/bin/bash  
  
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nginx

*   start\_nginx.sh

#!/bin/bash  
  
sudo systemctl start nginx  
sudo systemctl enable nginx

*   Make sure to change the buildspec.yaml file so that the CodeBuild will build the appspec.yml file and transfer the artifact to S3 bucket.

version: 0.2  
  
phases:  
  install:  
    commands:  
      \- echo Installing NGINX \- echo apt-get install NGINX  
      \- sudo apt-get update  
      \- sudo apt-get install nginx \-y  
  build:  
    commands:  
      \- echo Build started on date  
      \- cp index.html /var/www/html  
  post\_build:  
    commands:  
      \- echo Configuring NGINX  
artifacts:  
    files:  
      \- "\*\*/\*"

Here is all required files index.html, buildspec.yaml, appspec.yaml, install\_nginx.shand start\_nginx.sh.
